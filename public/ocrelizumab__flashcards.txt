Guidelines:
- Create ONLY 1-2 cards total 
- Focus on the most clinically relevant information 
- Create one cloze per fact (avoid multiple clozes in one card unless it is needed for reinforcing relationships between different elements) 
- Provide contextual information (never isolated facts) 
- Use hints with :: syntax only when needed (e.g., {{c1::term::hint}}) 
- Prefer individual cards for each list item.
- Use bidirectional phrasing where possible. 
- Format clozes as: {{c1::concept::hint}} or {{c1::term}}  
- Don't create back note
- when the information has list of items that needs to be memorized, create one card with multiple clozes
