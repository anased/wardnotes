# Category and Tag Management Feature

This new feature adds the ability for users to create, edit, and delete their own custom categories and tags for better organization of their medical notes.

## Overview

The feature allows users to:

- Create custom categories with different colors
- Edit existing categories
- Delete unused categories
- Create custom tags
- Edit existing tags
- Delete unused tags
- Use these custom categories and tags when creating or editing notes
- Get tag suggestions when typing in the tag input field

## Database Changes

The feature required adding two new tables to the Supabase database:

1. **categories** - Stores user-defined categories with name and color
2. **tags** - Stores user-defined tags

The database schema includes proper row-level security to ensure users can only access their own categories and tags.

## User Interface

The feature adds several new UI components:

1. **Settings Page** - A new central location for app settings including categories and tags
2. **Category Management** - A dedicated page for managing categories
3. **Tag Management** - A dedicated page for managing tags
4. **Enhanced Tag Input** - Tag input now supports suggestions from the user's existing tags
5. **Dynamic Category Badges** - Category badges now use colors defined by the user

## Navigation

The mobile navigation has been updated to include a link to the new Settings page.

## Considerations and Future Improvements

- **Category Archiving**: Instead of preventing deletion of in-use categories, we could add support for archiving
- **Tag Merging**: Add ability to merge tags with similar meanings
- **Tag Autocomplete**: Enhance tag suggestions with fuzzy matching

- **Category Icons**: Add support for custom icons for categories
